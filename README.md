# VidEffects
This is an Android library which can be used to apply different Filters/Effects on videos. It uses vertexShaders and fragmentShaders to apply effects on GLSurfaceView. It uses mediaPlayer instance for playing videos on GlSurcaeView. See the sample app in order to see a working demo.

### Limitations

The effects applied using this library are temporary. What that means is that the orignal video doesn't change. Effects are only applied during video playback and once the video ends the effects end with it. In the future, i am aiming to apply permanant effect to videos. You guys are welcome to help out.
